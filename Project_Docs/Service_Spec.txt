2. Core Features (Prototype Phase)
   A. Authentication & User System
      - Worker Login (Simple auth for prototype)
      - Profile Management (Job type, Safety implementation status)
      - Attendance Check (QR Code or Geofencing based)

   B. Real-time Location Safety (The "Killer App" Feature)
      - Map Visualization: Display User location vs. Construction Site Layout.
      - Danger Zones (Geofencing): Dynamic Red Zones (e.g., Heavy machinery operation area, Height work area).
      - Risk Alerts: Proximity alerts when approaching Danger Zones.
      - Technology: GPS (Outdoor) / Bluetooth Beacons (Indoor/Tunnel) - Simulation for Prototype.

   C. Safety Content & Compliance
      - Daily Safety Rules: Popups or Cards upon login tailored to user's assigned task.
      - Weather Integration: Rain/Wind alerts affecting work safety.
      - Safety Knowledge: Short quizzes or content cards.

      - SOS Button: One-touch emergency signal to Site Manager.
      - Evacuation Route: Display nearest exit on map.

3. User Interface (UI) Design Renewal Strategy
   - Legacy (12 years ago): Skeuomorphic, complex menus, dark static backgrounds.
   - Modern (2026):
      - Style: Glassmorphism, Large Typography, High Contrast for outdoor visibility.
      - Color Palette: Safety Yellow/Orange accents on Dark Mode (to save battery and reduce glare).
      - Interactions: Micro-animations for alerts and successful attendance.

4. Technology Stack
   - Frontend: React + Vite (Fast SPA).
   - State Management: React Context or Zustand (Lightweight).
   - Map: Leaflet (OpenStreetMap) for web compatibility.
   - UI Styling: Vanilla CSS (CSS Variables for theming) + Lucide Icons.
   - Backend: FastAPI (Async handling for real-time location data).
